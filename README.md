# Transposition Cypher

Cypher that rotates a rectangular representation of the message.
## Installation
Clone the repository, and, if necessary, run `chmod +x src/main.py` in your shell while in the main directory.
After this it should be runnable with the command `src/main.py`,
or, if you've added main.py's enclosing directory to your PATH,
simply `main.py` or whatever symlink you've chosen to set it to.
## Usage
Input will either be a message to encode with the current settings,
a keyword to change the current settings,
a keyword to display the current settings,
or a keyword to quit the application.

Type `help` for a list of keywords.
Keywords may have a value that you are setting in the format `key=val`,
with no whitespace surrounding the `=` sign.
